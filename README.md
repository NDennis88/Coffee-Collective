# Coffee Collective

Coffee Shop -- Work space application.

[Coffee Collective Link](https://nedak.github.io/Team4/ "Team4 Link")

## Description
The application gives users access to Top Rated coffee shops within the greater Sacramento Area. The ratings reflect users' 'non-negotiables,' such as Wifi strength, work space accommodations, food and beverage variety, and parking convenience.

Once the user searches by zip code, they are matched with a list of 10 coffee shops, an interactive map, and previous reviews from the Collective database. Users are greatly encouraged to provide feedback each time they visit a new location; this data is stored in Firebase for persistent data storage, sorted, and displayed in the Review Section using Chart.js.

Each review strengthens the Collective (ratings) and allows users a more streamlined list of coffee shops / work spaces in the future. Development goals for the app include: creating a user login, implementing a communication board for users to display meet-ups or professional mixers, and extending the beta app to other metropolitan cities.
